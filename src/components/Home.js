    <h1 className='text-center text-green-500 text-3xl'>Welcome to my Automations Homepage</h1>
    <p>This site is primarily to give myself a little visibility into some automations I have running on some cloud servers, but I'm also trying to make available any generally useful things that I've created.</p>
    <p>Right now, the only thing to do is sign up for emails regarding some <a className='text-blue-500' href='https://www.familylife.com/articles/topics/marriage/staying-married/husbands/50-ways-to-inspire-your-wife/' target='_blank'>marriage advice I came across online</a>. Enjoy!</p>
    <p className='text-center'>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
